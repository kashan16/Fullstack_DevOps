# Fullstack Development Learning Path

## **Month 1: Fullstack Foundations & Backend Basics**

### **Week 1: Advanced Frontend & Environment Setup (Days 1–7)**

- [x] Set up your development environment (install VS Code, Node.js, Git)
- [ ] Review basic HTML & CSS fundamentals
- [ ] Deep dive into advanced JavaScript (closures, scopes, prototypes)
- [ ] Study asynchronous programming: callbacks, promises, async/await
- [ ] Review React fundamentals (component structure, props, state)
- [ ] Practice React hooks (useState, useEffect) with small examples
- [ ] Project: Build a simple React mini‑app (e.g., a counter or list) using hooks
- [ ] Commit your work to GitHub and document key learnings/questions

### **Weeks 3–4: RESTful API & Basic Database Integration**

- [ ] Learn RESTful API design.
- [ ] Introduce a database (start with PostgreSQL or MongoDB) and integrate it with your backend.
- [ ] Implement user authentication (JWT-based).
- [ ] Project Enhancement: Upgrade your app with persistent data storage and authentication.

## **Month 3: Begin DevOps Fundamentals & Containerization**

### **Week 1: Linux and Command Line Proficiency**

- [ ] Get comfortable with basic Linux commands and shell scripting.

### **Week 2: Docker Basics**

- [ ] Learn Docker fundamentals and containerize your fullstack application.

### **Weeks 3–4: CI/CD Pipelines**

- [ ] Explore CI/CD concepts and set up a pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or Jenkins).
- [ ] Integrate automated testing and deployment for your app.
- [ ] Project: Update your project to run inside Docker containers and automatically deploy/test on code commits.

---

## **Month 4: Cloud Deployment & Infrastructure as Code**

### **Weeks 1–2: Cloud Provider Essentials**

- [ ] Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and complete a beginner course.
- [ ] Learn how to deploy applications (start with services like AWS EC2/ECS or similar offerings).

### **Week 3: Infrastructure as Code**

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with Terraform (or CloudFormation) to manage your cloud resources.

### **Week 4: Cloud Project Deployment**

- [ ] Deploy your containerized app to the cloud using your chosen provider.
- [ ] Experiment with scaling and basic security setups.

---

## **Month 5: Container Orchestration & Monitoring**

### **Weeks 1–2: Kubernetes Basics**

- [ ] Learn the fundamentals of Kubernetes and container orchestration.
- [ ] Practice deploying your Dockerized app on a small Kubernetes cluster (using Minikube or a managed service).

### **Week 3: Monitoring & Logging**

- [ ] Introduce monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana (or similar) to track your app’s performance.
- [ ] Understand basic logging practices and tools.

### **Week 4: Integrate and Optimize**

- [ ] Fine-tune your CI/CD pipeline, cloud deployment, and monitoring setup.
- [ ] Project: Update your app to include container orchestration and monitoring, ensuring a smooth deployment pipeline.

---

## **Month 6: Final Portfolio Project & Job Prep**

### **Weeks 1–3: Comprehensive Final Project**

Build a full-scale project that integrates:
- [ ] A React frontend with a robust Node/Express (or TypeScript) backend.
- [ ] A connected database with proper authentication.
- [ ] Docker containerization, a CI/CD pipeline, and deployment to the cloud.
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code and orchestration (Kubernetes) with monitoring/logging.
- [ ] Document your project thoroughly (readme, technical blog posts, etc.) to showcase your skills.

### **Week 4: Job Preparation**

- [ ] Prepare your resume and LinkedIn.
- [ ] Practice coding interviews and technical questions.
- [ ] Start applying to full-stack and DevOps roles.
